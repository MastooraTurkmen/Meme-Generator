# Meme Generator

Asalamu Alikum there,


This is my other React Project: Meme Generator. There you can click Get a new meme images and get lots of funny meme images. And also you can write on Top text and Bottom text.
Thank you So much:))))


1. By writing text the _**Top Text**_ input, you can see words on the top of the image
2. By writing text the _**Bottom Text**_ input, you can see words on the bottom of the image

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
